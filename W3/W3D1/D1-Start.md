# Alert (3min - No Questions)
* This will be overwhelming. In order to center youselves for what's is about to come, we need to take breaks and you need to keep this in mind. Or at least your version of this;
    * "After the storm when the trees are broken and the houses are lain to waste, it is the grass that stands as though nothing happened.
    * You are all now blades of grass. Do your best to bend with the wind and do not attempt to fully understand anything.
    * This is going to be a progressive experience and as time marches on you'll understand more and more.
    * I will talk about things like JSX, you will see JSX, but you won't fully understand it for months. These two weeks all you need to be able to do is apply what you see at a basic level.
    * From this basic level you will all grow and expand your knowledge. Like David once commented about jQuery, it's overwhelming, but we pack in what is needed to get you to place that you can grow.
    * Between now and then is only survival.

<!--
Thoughts
        1. Demo todo app using ES6
        2. Convert App to React
            * JSX/App structure
            * Import/Export syntax!
                * Note how to import React 'components'
            * Import css is different from any native JS style
        3. Focus on React concepts during build.  Build without state initially!!
        4. Focus on state and props when that is add into the build.
-->

* ES6 Review
    * String Literals
    * Expressions vs Statements
    * Object Destructuring
    * Array Destructuring
    * Spread & Rest
    * ES Modules (Import/Export)
* React Concepts
    * JSX
    * Object/Store/State
* Live Demo be sure to focus on `state and props`
