          * ReactDOM is what you use to 'Render' those components, see:
              * ReactDOM.render
              * import ReactDOM, { render as Render } from 'react-dom';
              * ReactDOM.render(myelement, document.getElementById('root'));

              * https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html
      * Who wants to see something destructured? ReactDOM.render === {render}
  * Talk about the Scheduler app.
