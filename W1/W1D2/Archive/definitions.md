## Section

## Article
The article element represents a complete, or self-contained, composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is, in principle, independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication.

**Example:**
<article>
  <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
</article>


# Aside
The aside element could be used to wrap a portion of content that is tangential to a specific standalone piece of content (such as an article or section).

**Example:**
<aside>
  <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
</aside>
