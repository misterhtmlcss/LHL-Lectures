# First Day! Introductions!
## Welcome!! (3-5min)
* I'm Roger
* Joke (Dad joke || programmer joke)
    * `How do you tell HTML from HTML5? Try it out in Internet Explorer. Did it work? No? Itâ€™s HTML5.`
* Let's talk about remote lecture protocols and procedures
    * All lectures are recorded
    * Show up a few minutes early, so you are ready
    * Please mute your mic by default.
    * Raise your hands for questions; there is a button for that
    * Feedback! Please be critical of my lectures, but please be articulate and please share positive feedback too. I want to do my best for you and feeling good about things I do well is both helpful for my mental health and great motivation too. Plus having a clear understanding of what I can do better equally so. My goal is to see you all perform your very best.

## In-Class Housekeeping (6-8min)
* Does anyone have questions about the tools they've been using:
    * Compass?
    * Slack?
    * Assistance Requests?
* Slack:
    * Please update your Slack so the name on display is your full name. This makes it easier to connect with you in Slack. It's a privacy issue. So pretty please!!
* Assistance Requests (AR):
    * Feel free to ask for a code review after any of your work is completed. I would recommend not waiting until you have lots of code to review. Getting that support early will really improve your confidence.
    * Keep ARs on topic and focused.
* Community Driven Education:
    * Help each other. Don't feel intense pressure to do so, but know that helping others results in a few positives:
      * You learn the material better
      * You reduce social situational stress in a safe space
      * Improve technical communication skills.
      * `All 3 of these will improve your employment outcomes.`
* Going for a walk; staring at a wall; reading a book, watching a cat video, talking with someone about the weather. Sometimes you need a mental break; start to understand the internal signals for when that's necessary. Angry, frustration, sadness, tired, obsessiveness, etc. All can be signals.
