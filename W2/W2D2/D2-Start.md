## Welcome!! (3-5min)
* Good morning Everyone!!


## In-Class Housekeeping (6-8min)
* Does anyone have questions about the tools they've been using:
    * Compass?
    * Slack?
    * Assistance Requests?
* Slack:
    * Please update your Slack so the name on display is your full name. This makes it easier to connect with you in Slack. It's a privacy issue. So pretty please!!
* Assistance Requests (AR):
    * Feel free to ask for a code review after any of your work is completed. I would recommend not waiting until you have lots of code to review. Getting that support early will really improve your confidence.
    * Keep ARs on topic and focused.
* Community Driven Education:
    * Help each other. Don't feel intense pressure to do so, but know that helping others results in a few positives:
      * You learn the material better
      * You reduce social situational stress in a safe space
      * Improve technical communication skills.
      * `All 3 of these will improve your employment outcomes.`
* Going for a walk; staring at a wall; reading a book, watching a cat video, talking with someone about the weather. Sometimes you need a mental break; start to understand the internal signals for when that's necessary. Angry, frustration, sadness, tired, obsessiveness, etc. All can be signals.
