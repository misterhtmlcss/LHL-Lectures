## Lecture (15-20min)
* Bridge-in (2min)
* Objective/Outcome (2min)
* Pre-Assessment (2-4min)
* Lecture (10-15min)
    * Let's talk jQuery!!
    * Where is jQuery?
    * What is jQuery...Library;
        * collection of reusable functions vs
        * a framework which is made up of libraries where the structure is defined for you.
    * Why is it important to use jQuery!? 50%+ of the web still uses it as legacy. You can't modernize a website so well if you don't know the tool used to create it.
