## HOUSE KEEPING
* Next lecture will be a reflect and review session like last week. Please take a moment to think about your week and consider you
* Demo Day Information!
    * Keep your talks to 2-3min
    * Please be supportive of each other, by asking questions, clapping and giving the person a positive visual response. Questions; probably just 1 or 2 if the person was particularly quick.
    * I'm going to pick the roster based on this session and that way it's less of a surprise during the demo day. How does that work? Does anyone need to leave early? If so please tell me and we can move you to the front of the lineup.
    * Speaking roster:
        * Enzo D
        * Ayrton Mule
        * Stefano C
        * Casey Joy
        * David Ogbeide
        * Brock Mills
        * Guillaume Langelier
        * Jin Kwan Kim
        * Matt McDonald
        * Andy Lam

* Next week we will start on React. This is going to be fun!
